devWiki is a Jekyll powered knowledge base and API for web developers. I came up with the idea when learning web dev and trying to find resources all over the internet. I started by creating my own database in [notion](https://notion.io). This soon became my idea for my final project while taking the Web Developer prgoram at [SAIT](https://sait.ca)

## Goals of the project

- To have as many developer resources in one site
- Keep as much as possible in a static website
- Adhere to the jamstack principles 
- Keep all audits above 90% on lighthouse 

## Features

- A dedicated blog with notes from SAIT
- Everything I've learned about web dev so far
- Cheat sheets
- Development docs 


## Coming Soon

- A rest api

## Dependencies

- Minimal Mistakes Theme

### Installation

This App is still in development
