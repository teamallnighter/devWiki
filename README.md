# devWiki

devWiki is a Jekyll powered knowledge base and API for web developers. I came up with the idea when learning web dev and trying to find resources all over the internet. I started by creating my own database in [notion](https://notion.io). This soon became my idea for my final project while taking the Web Developer prgoram at [SAIT](https://sait.ca)

### Primary Goal 

To have as many developer resources in one site 

### 

Secondary goal to be able to keep everything in a staticly generated site and stick to standard jamstack principles. As of right now this site scores 90% and above on all lighthouse audits. 

## Features

- A dedicated blog with notes from SAIT
- Everything I've learned about web dev so far
- Cheat sheets (care of [devhints.io](http://devhints.io)) An open source project providing extremely useful cheatsheets.
- Development docs (care of [devdocs](https://devdocs.io)(An open source scraping platform that collects development docs)
- Quick reference search
- CSV Database of resources 
- A rest api
- A custom markdown editor 

## Coming Soon

- A rest api testing playground 

## Dependencies

- Jekyll
- Minimal Mistakes Theme

### Installation

This App is still in development
