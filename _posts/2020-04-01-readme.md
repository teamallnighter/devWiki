# The Dev Bible

The dev bible is a Jekyll powered knowledge base and API for web developers. I came up with the idea when learning web dev and trying to find resources all over the internet. I started by creating my own database in [notion](https://notion.io). This soon became my idea for my final project while taking the Web Developer prgoram at [SAIT](https://sait.ca)

## Features

- A dedicated blog with notes from SAIT
- Everything I've learned about web dev so far
- Cheat sheets
- Quick reference search

## Coming Soon

- The API!
  
The page is created with most recent JAMSTACK principles and uses Jekyll and serverless technology to deliver information quickly and efficiantly.

## Dependencies

- Jekyll
- Minimal Mistakes Theme

### Installation

This App is still in development
