# Empty Elements

### Empty elements

Not all elements follow the above pattern of an opening tag, content, and a closing tag. Some elements consist only of a single tag, which is usually used to insert/embed something in the document at the place it is included. For example, the `[<img>](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img)` element embeds an image file onto a page in the position it is included in:

    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mdn/beginner-html-site/gh-pages/images/firefox-icon.png">

Note: Empty elements are also sometimes called void elements.
