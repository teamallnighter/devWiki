# The Anatomy of an HTML element

The main parts of our element are:

- **The opening tag:** This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing **angle brackets**. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect — in this case where the start of the paragraph is.
- **The closing tag:** This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the end of the paragraph is. Failing to include a closing tag is a common beginner error and can lead to strange results.
- **The content:** This is the content of the element, which in this case is just text.
- **The element:** The opening tag plus the closing tag plus the content equals the element.
