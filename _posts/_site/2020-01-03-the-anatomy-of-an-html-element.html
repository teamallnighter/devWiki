<p>The main parts of our element are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>The opening tag:</strong> This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing <strong>angle brackets</strong>. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect — in this case where the start of the paragraph is.</li>
  <li><strong>The closing tag:</strong> This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the end of the paragraph is. Failing to include a closing tag is a common beginner error and can lead to strange results.</li>
  <li><strong>The content:</strong> This is the content of the element, which in this case is just text.</li>
  <li><strong>The element:</strong> The opening tag plus the closing tag plus the content equals the element.</li>
</ul>
