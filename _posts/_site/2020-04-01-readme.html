<h1 id="the-dev-bible">The Dev Bible</h1>

<p>The dev bible is a Jekyll powered knowledge base and API for web developers. I came up with the idea when learning web dev and trying to find resources all over the internet. I started by creating my own database in <a href="https://notion.io">notion</a>. This soon became my idea for my final project while taking the Web Developer prgoram at <a href="https://sait.ca">SAIT</a></p>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

<ul>
  <li>A dedicated blog with notes from SAIT</li>

</ul>
